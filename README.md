## Facial Verification
Welcome to the repository for my Facial Verification System, which is implemented using Siamese Neural Networks. This project is inspired by the research paper, "Siamese Neural Networks for One-shot Image Recognition" by Gregory Koch, Richard Zemel, and Ruslan Salakhutdinov. Below, I explain the key concepts I learned from the paper and how I applied them to develop a facial verification system.

## Understanding Siamese Networks
## Problem Statement
In facial recognition, traditional models often struggle when only a few images of a person are available. One-shot learning, as introduced in the paper, addresses this by training models to generalize well with very limited data. The Siamese Neural Network architecture is ideal for face verification, where the goal is to determine whether two images belong to the same person or not.

## Siamese Neural Network Architecture
A Siamese network consists of two identical networks (often called "twins") that share weights and architecture. Each network processes one of the input images, and the outputs are compared using a distance metric (here, L1 distance) to determine their similarity. If the images are of the same person, the distance will be small; otherwise, it will be larger.

## Training the Model
The model is trained to minimize the distance between images of the same person and maximize the distance between images of different people. By using pairs of images labeled as "same" or "different," the network learns to discriminate between the two classes. Weight sharing between the twin networks ensures consistent transformations on both inputs, which improves generalization.

## One-shot Learning and Face Verification
One of the strongest aspects of Siamese networks is their ability to generalize to new classes with only one or two examples, making them ideal for face verification tasks. After training, the model can be used to compare any new image with a reference (anchor) image and determine if they belong to the same person. This approach works well even without extensive retraining, a significant advantage over traditional deep learning models.

## Project Overview
This project implements a Facial Verification System using Siamese Neural Networks. The system captures live images via webcam, preprocesses them, and trains a model to verify whether two faces belong to the same person.

## Key Features
Captures images via webcam for training and verification.
Uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to generate embeddings (feature vectors) for each input image.
Employs L1 Distance between the embeddings to determine the similarity of two images.
Performs real-time face verification with live webcam input.
## How This Project Works
## Features and Capabilities
Facial Verification: The model compares two facial images and predicts whether they belong to the same person.
Siamese Network Architecture: The twin networks share weights and learn to extract meaningful features.
One-shot Learning: Can generalize well even when given only one or two examples of a new class.
Data Augmentation: The network is trained using affine transformations to make it more robust to variations such as rotation, scaling, or positional shifts.
## Dataset
The model is designed to work with facial image datasets where pairs of images are labeled as "same" or "different." For this project, I worked with a custom facial image dataset, but the architecture can be adapted to other datasets easily. You can use the Labeled Faces in the Wild dataset:

Setup Instructions
Clone the repository:

```
[git clone https://github.com/your-username/facial-verification-siamese.git]
[cd facial-verification-siamese]
(https://github.com/geeranlone/Siamese-Neural-Networks-for-One-shot-Image-Recognition.git)
```
Install dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```




## Model Architecture
The model consists of convolutional layers to extract image features followed by a dense layer that generates a 4096-dimensional embedding.
The custom L1Dist layer computes the absolute difference between the embeddings of two input images, and a sigmoid function is applied to classify the pair as "same" or "different."
Usage
## Data Collection
The system allows for the collection of anchor and positive/negative images using the webcam:

Press a to capture an anchor image.
Press p to capture a positive image (same person).
Press q to quit the webcam session.
## Real-time Verification
Once the model is trained, you can use real-time webcam input to verify faces:

Press v to verify an image.
The model will predict whether the captured image matches the anchor image.
