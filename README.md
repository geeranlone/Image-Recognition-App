# Facial Verification Using Siamese Neural Networks

Welcome to the repository for my facial verification project, which is built using Siamese Neural Networks. This implementation is inspired by the research paper, "Siamese Neural Networks for One-shot Image Recognition" by Gregory Koch, Richard Zemel, and Ruslan Salakhutdinov. This paper presents a novel approach for one-shot learning, which I have adapted here for facial recognition tasks. Below, I'll walk you through the key concepts I learned from the paper and how I applied them to this project.

## Understanding Siamese Networks

### Problem Statement
The challenge addressed in the paper revolves around the limitations of traditional machine learning models when dealing with tasks where only a few examples are available, known as **one-shot learning**. Specifically, in facial recognition, we may only have one or two images of a person, making it difficult for a standard model to generalize well.

To overcome this, Siamese Neural Networks were introduced, which can effectively rank the similarity between two inputs. This makes them ideal for tasks like **face verification**, where the goal is to determine whether two images belong to the same person or not, even with very few examples.

### Siamese Neural Network Architecture
A Siamese network consists of **two identical networks** (often called "twins") that share the same architecture and parameters. These twin networks take two different input images and process them through the same series of convolutional layers. The key insight here is that **the two networks learn to compare the images** by projecting them into a shared feature space.

The outputs of these twin networks are compared using a **distance metric** (in this case, L1 distance), which measures how similar the two images are. If the images are of the same person, the distance will be small, and if they're of different people, the distance will be larger.

### Training the Model
The model is trained in a way that it learns to minimize the distance between images of the same person and maximize the distance between images of different people. During training, I used pairs of images labeled as either "same" (from the same person) or "different" (from different people), and the network learns to discriminate between these pairs.

The paper emphasizes that **sharing weights between the twin networks** is crucial to ensure that the same transformations are applied to both inputs. This enforces consistency in the learned features, which in turn leads to better generalization.

### One-shot Learning and Face Verification
One of the most interesting aspects of Siamese networks is their ability to perform well in **one-shot learning scenarios**. Since the model doesnâ€™t need extensive retraining for new classes, it can be used to verify faces of people it has never seen before, which is a perfect fit for applications like **facial verification** or **security systems**.

For example, if given just one image of a person, the model can compare it with any new image and determine whether they belong to the same person or not. This is achieved without needing large amounts of labeled data, which is a significant advantage over conventional deep learning models.

## How This Project Works

### Features and Capabilities
- **Facial Verification**: The model compares two facial images and predicts whether they belong to the same person.
- **Siamese Network Architecture**: Employs twin convolutional networks that share weights to extract meaningful features.
- **One-shot Learning**: Can generalize well even when given only a single example of a new class (i.e., a person it has not seen before).
- **Data Augmentation**: The network is trained using affine transformations to make it more robust to variations in the images, such as rotation, scaling, or shifts in position.

### Dataset
The model is designed to work with facial image datasets where image pairs are labeled as "same" or "different." This is the training format that allows the model to learn how to compare images effectively.

For this project, I worked with a custom facial image dataset, but the architecture can be easily adapted to other datasets following the same principles.
